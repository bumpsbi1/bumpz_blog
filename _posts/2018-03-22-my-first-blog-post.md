So far starting off I have tried to learn. HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, NodeJS, AngularJS, ReactJS. I have taken 
multiple online courses including 2 bootcamps. My evening are usually watching youtube video learning or refreshing my 
knowledge on a certain language. I love the feel of completing a project and admiring the outcome of my hard work.

Right now my focus is back on honing my skill in the CSS world. I am learning more about animations and way that I can 
create content by just using CSS.
