Today I was reading about some great books to read to improve my knowledge about web development. My main focus is on javascript but I do get side tracked from time to time with learning new languages or frame works. In the article it had mentioned a great book to read is "Eloquent Javascript: By Marijn Haverbeke". After downloading it I tried reading through it but I found my self in the same position I usually do with my dyslexia. I get to focused on straightening the words and forget the information I just read. So about 10 pages in I was ready to put the book down and find a different method. I remembered that kindles to have the capability of reading book in sort of a text to speech format but I could not find the feature. After googling a some trick I found that I had the wrong format for my kindle to supply that feature. So I found the correct format and voila... I was set. I did also get some more CSS Tutorials in today as well. I find that I am learning a good amount from the "thenetninja".
