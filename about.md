I start getting into computers at a young age like many others. Of course there was some set backs on learning like crashing computers, accidental remove of important data bases, virus installation. But through out the early bad stuff I learn from my mistakes. Mainly learning windows operating system throughout high school. Then in college spreading my wings into the Linux world. Acquired the knowledge on how the hardware workings of PC's. How to fix and maintain systems as well as great knowledge on networking. It did not stop there....I soon wanted to know more about how the web works and the development of it. I have spent a great amount of time learning the awesomeness of the web.

Here are some of the project that I have done:
